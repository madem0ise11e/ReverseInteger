/* This program takes an integer input from the user.
Then the while loop is used until n != 0 is false (0).
In each iteration of the loop,
the remainder when n is divided by 10
is calculated and the value of n is reduced by 10 times.
Inside the loop, the reversed number is computed using:
rev = rev*10 + remainder;
